This project uses a simple filesystem store (`STORE_DIR`) rather than a relational DB by default.

If you plan to use a DB, add migration scripts here (e.g. Alembic) and provide a `migrations/env.py` configured
to connect using environment variables.

Current project: no DB migrations are required.
