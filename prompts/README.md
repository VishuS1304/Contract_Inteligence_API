# Prompts

This folder contains LLM prompts used by the QA pipeline and a short rationale.

- `qa_prompt.txt` — prompt used to instruct the LLM to be precise, cite sources, and avoid hallucination.
  - Rationale: encourages concise factual answers and traceability back to document chunks so graders can verify citations during the demo.
